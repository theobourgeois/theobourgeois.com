## What is WebEQ?
WebEQ is an audio equalizer I created for the web. I made it primarily because I find audio equalizers visually interesting, and I wanted to add my spin to one.

I designed it so you can add as many control points as you want, giving you complete control over the audio spectrum. And I think it looks cool ;)
