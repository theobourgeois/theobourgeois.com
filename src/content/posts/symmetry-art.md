## What is Symmetry Art 

Symmetry Art is a drawing app with a twist: you can make intricate symmetrical designs.

I realized that there doesn't seem to be any website that allows you to create symmetries with a arbitrary number of segments. I found this a very visually interesting and challenging project. I think the results are really cool.
