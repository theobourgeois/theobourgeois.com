## What is SoundSeer?

SoundSeer is a project I created to visualize sound waves when they are combined. As I progressed with the project, I added more features, such as an audio player and a way to programmatically add patterns in the audio player.

I'm really interested in creating visually interesting projects, and this is the one that truly sparked that interest. Creating sine waves in the HTML canvas was something I found really cool and still do, as you can see in my other projects.
