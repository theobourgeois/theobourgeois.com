## What is TrackRack?

As someone who makes music with friends, I always find myself jumping through hoops trying to send audio files. They're often too big, or I end up losing them because they're unorganized. I wanted a way to organize the files related to my songs in a format that made sense and share them with whoever I wanted. This is what motivated me to create TrackRack.

TrackRack is, in its most basic form, a file storage website. Files are stored in a format familiar to musicians: tracks. Tracks contain all the elements of a songâ€”the stems, album cover, demos, etc. Tracks are stored in Projects, which can be albums, EPs, Mixtapes, etc. Storing audio files this way facilitates the progression and improvement of a song.

To enhance this improvement aspect, invited users can provide their feedback through comments. With comments, discussions about the music can be centralized, removing the necessity of using third-party chat apps to communicate.

Overall, TrackRack gives musicians a more ergonomic way to create music. It allows them to streamline their work and improve it.

## How I created TrackRack

TrackRack is a [NextJS 14](https://nextjs.org/) app created with the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/). The frontend and backend are both in TypeScript, using [TRPC](https://trpc.io/) to interact from front-end to back-end. It uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM and [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com/) to store files.

### NextJS 14
I've enjoyed using NextJS 14, although I've faced a few challenges with the technology. I'm very familiar with React, but NextJS 14 introduced a feature known as server components. React Server Components (RSCs) are essentially server-rendered React components. This allows your app to skip a trip from the server to the client and send the HTML instead. This can be very useful for more static webpages. It both speeds up load times and can simplify the developer experience. RSCs allow the use of async functions inside components because they are only rendered once. This eliminates the need to hold async values in a state or use libraries like React Query.

```typescript
async function getPosts() {
  // Fetch posts
}

async function ServerRenderedComponent() {
  const posts = await getPosts();

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The downsides to NextJS 14 come when you need your website to perform more dynamic rendering. When you need reactivity, you can use NextJS client-rendered components. These behave just like traditional React components, although you have to add the `"use client"` directive to client-component files. This seems simple enough, but there is a hard rule you need to keep track of.

Server components cannot live within a client component. Once you make a client component, all children must be client components as well. There is a workaround to this, and it's to pass in a server component as a prop/child to a client component. However, doing this a lot can ruin your code's readability and quickly increase complexity. Keeping track of this rule isn't hard, but deciding whether to use a server component or a client component can become confusing, especially when requirements keep changing, and server components need to be made into client components or vice-versa.

Overall, my experience with NextJS 14 was good, but I ran into a few problems along the way.

### TRPC

[TypeScript Remote Control Procedure (TRPC)](https://trpc.io/) is a TypeScript library used to provide a type-safe API between the TypeScript front-end and back-end. The T3 stack sets up TRPC, which works by creating routes where you can define your backend functions. Here's an example:

```typescript
export const projectsRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  get: publicProcedure
    .input(
      z.object({
        projectUrl: z.string().optional(),
        id: z.string().optional(),
      })
    )
    .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      return ctx.db.project.findFirst({
        include: {
          // Include related entities
        },
      });
    }),
  changePrivacy: protectedProcedure
    .input(
      z.object({
        projectId: z.string(),
        isPrivate: z.boolean(),
      })
    )
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      return ctx.db.project.update({
        where: { id: input.projectId },
        data: { isPrivate: input.isPrivate },
      });
    }),
});
```

This example shows the router for the `projects` entity. We first define the router with the `createTRPCRouter` function. We then define procedures such as `get` or `changePrivacy`. Each procedure that accepts parameters must be validated through a zod schema. `.query` is where the logic for the procedure is defined.

To use a procedure is as simple as:

```typescript
const project = await api.projects.get.query({
  projectUrl: params.project,
});
```

## Moving Forward

As you may have noticed, I didn't deploy TrackRack. The truth is, file storage is expensive. I may rewrite this app in the future to optimize file storage. I currently rely on UploadThing, which is an Amazon S3 wrapper for NextJS. I'll probably want more control over file storage in the future, which will necessitate migrating technologies. I'll probably also decide to test TrackRack with my friends, then release it gradually.

Overall, TrackRack has been a fun passion project to work on. It was my first big full-stack app, and it challenged me to learn all these new technologies.
